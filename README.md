# EVRICS Projekt
Electric Vehicle Road Inductor Charging System

Researcher: Wilson Dhalwani and Benjamin Brnic <br />
Advisor: Mr. Carlos Nodarse (BCA) <br />
Context: BCA Mechatronics Research <br />
Projekt Name: EVRICS: A Novel Idea in the Field of Magnetic Induction Charging Systems <br />
Start Date: April 1, 2022 <br />

The following repository is for documenting and sharing my work in this research projekt and its related fields of engineering. This projekt was started by myself and a fellow friend and engineering student, Benjamin Brnic, under the mentorship of Mr. Carlos Nodarse. This projekt was inspired by recent work with electric vehicles and the emergence of practical electric vehicles. The idea of this projekt was to create and efficent and convient way of charging and mainting electric vehicles. This projekt created a system that could be retrofitted into most highways or large roadways for charging electric vehicles in the US and abroad. This projekt has no end date as innovation never ends, rather, continues until the idea is forgotten, and my hope is that this work can be the basis for future engineers who, too, find great excitement in innovation and design. <br />
