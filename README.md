# EVRICS Project
Electric Vehicle Road Inductor Charging System

Researcher: Wilson Dhalwani and Benjamin Brnic <br />
Advisor: Mr. Carlos Nodarse (BCA) <br />
Context: BCA Mechatronics Research <br />
Project Name: EVRICS: A Novel Idea in the Field of Magnetic Induction Charging Systems <br />
Start Date: March 25, 2022 <br />

The following repository is for documenting and sharing my work in this research project and its related fields of engineering. This project was started by myself and a fellow friend and engineering student, Benjamin Brnic, under the mentorship of Mr. Carlos Nodarse. This project was inspired by recent work with electric vehicles and the emergence of practical electric vehicles. The idea of this project was to create an efficient and convenient way of charging and maintaining electric vehicles. This project created a system that could be retrofitted into most highways or large roadways for charging electric vehicles in the US and abroad. This project has no end date as innovation never ends, rather, it continues until the idea is forgotten, and I hope that this work can be the basis for future engineers who, too, find great excitement in innovation and design. <br />
